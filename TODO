-- Fix Xinerama support
-- Add more command-line args
-- Add rc file
-- Add configure script
-- Separate cat and rainbow into separate draw calls (and image files)
-- Add man page(?)

-- Fullscreen resolution autodetect broken by most recent update
-> Fixed this temporarily but CPU usage is still proving very high/cat scaling is a bit off for wide monitors
-> Defaulting to the small cat until I can re-implement Xinerama support and fix scaling issues on wide setups
